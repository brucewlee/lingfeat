## Overview

LingFeat is a Python research package for various handcrafted linguistic features. More specifically, LingFeat is an NLP feature extraction software, which currently extracts 255 linguistic features from **English** string input. 

These features can be divided into five broad linguistic branches:
1. **Advanced Semantic** (AdSem): for measuing complexity of meaning structures
   - *Semantic Richness, Noise, and Clarity from trained LDA models (included, no training required)*

2. **Discourse** (Disco): for measuring coherence/cohesion
   - *Entity Counts, Entity Grid, and Local Coherence score*

3. **Syntactic** (Synta): for measuring the complexity of grammar and structure
   - *Phrasal Counts (e.g. Noun Phrase), Part-of-Speech Counts, and Tree Structure*

4. **Lexico Semantic** (LxSem): for measuring word/phrasal-specific difficulty
   - *Type Token Ratio, Variation Score (e.g. Verb Variation), Age-of-Acquistion, and SubtlexUS Frequency*

5. **Shallow Traditional** (ShTra): traditional features/formulas for text difficulty
   - *Basic Average Counts (words per sentence), Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease, Smog, Gunning Fog, ...*

## Things to note
LingFeat is built for text complexity/difficulty/readability analysis.

We provide guidelines for both basic users and advanced users. Please follow [Usage](#usage) section.

The features contained in this software are inspired from readability assessment (RA) research, a time-honored branch of NLP. Some key references are listed in this documentation.

## Citation
This software is built mainly for our paper on 

> **Pushing on Text Readability Assessment: A Transformer Meets Handcrafted Linguistic Features**, EMNLP (Nov. 2021, Dominican Republic).

*Please cite our paper and provide link to this repository* if you use in this software in research.

Most supported features are developed for passage analysis. One sentence input will work fine with the program but won't produce reliable output.

## Installation

**Option 1.** Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install LingFeat. (not supported now)
```bash
pip install lingfeat
```

**Option 2.** Install from the repo. 

You'll need to install the dependencies, including spaCy, by yourself. Ideally, use virtual environment (optional).

Use code below for option 2.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brucewlee/lingfeat.git
pip install -r lingfeat/requirements.txt
```
   
## Usage

A. **General Purpose (basic)**

If you aren't deeply interested in linguistics, you usually don't require the full feature set of LingFeat.

The following code returns a dictionary of 6 outputs from commonly used formulas in predicting readability:
- Flesch Kincaid Grade Level *(Feature Code: FleschG_S)*
- Automated Readability Index *(Feature Code: AutoRea_S)*
- Coleman Liau Readability Score *(Feature Code: ColeLia_S)*
- Smog Index *(Feature Code: SmogInd_S)*
- Gunning Fog Count Score *(Feature Code: Gunning_S)*
- Linsear Write Formula Score *(Feature Code: LinseaW_S)*
  
These formulas are a little outdated... but still widely used.

They are designed to match U.S. grade level from 1~12 (i.e. average student of the grade can read the text). 

Ideally, you could average these 6 outputs to obtain a reliable outcome.
```python
from lingfeat import extractor

text = "..."

LingFeat = extractor.pass_text(text)

LingFeat.preprocess()

TraF = LingFeat.TraF_()

print(TraF)

```

B. **Research/ML/NLP Purpose (advanced)**

B.1 ***Spacy Requirements***

This library assumes that you have spaCy sm corpus installed. If not, or if you aren't sure, run (in terminal)
> python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


B.2. ***Example***

Due to the wide number of supported features, we defined *subgroups* for features. Hence, features are not accessible individually. Instead, you'd call the *subgroups* to obtain the dictionary of the corresponding features.

To broadly understand how these features interact with text readability, difficulty, and complexity, I highly suggest you read Section 2 and 3 in our EMNLP paper.
```python
"""
Import

this is the only import you need
"""
from lingfeat import extractor


"""
Pass text

here, text must be in string type
"""
text = "..."
LingFeat = extractor.pass_text(text)


"""
Preprocess text

options (all boolean):
- short (default False): include short words of < 3 letters
- see_token (default False): return token list
- see_sent_token (default False): return tokens in sentences

output:
- n_token
- n_sent
- token_list (optional)
- sent_token_list (optional)
"""
LingFeat.preprocess()
# or
# print(LingFeat.preprocess())


"""
Extract features

each method returns a dictionary of the corresponding features
